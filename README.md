# Cross Shard Simulation for Ethereum 2.0

In this simulation we will model the execution of cross shard transactions the Ethereum 2.0 platform using varying sharding strategies.

### Factors to be considered:
	- Duration of cross shard communication
	- Network Load (Queue size)
	- Slot times
	- Probability of a reorg 

### Details collected on the transaction:
	- Execution Time
	- State Size
	- Transaction Throughput
	- Transaction Size
	- Wait time for finality
